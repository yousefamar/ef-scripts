# EF Scripts

Scripts and datavis to help with [EF](https://www.joinef.com/) team building.

## Usage

`ef-graph.html` and `ef-graph-normalised.html` are just static webpages that self-describe what they do. They need a `profiles.json` to visualise though, which can be generated by running `node parse.js`.

`node parse.js` requires a `profiles.edn`, which you'll notice is gitignored (to avoid putting people's personal data on GitHub). Either cURL your own off of the programme dashboard, or ask me for the LD14 one.

`node populate-sheet.js` uses the Google Sheets API to make a nice spreadsheet of people. It requires `profiles.edn`, `members.edn`, and `questions.edn` from the dashboard. Your best bet is to ask me for my my version of this spreadsheet, which also has conditional formatting, notes from meeting and video intros, tick boxes for shortlisting co-founders, and other useful features. Otherwise, you need to replace the hardcoded sheet ID and get your own credentials (API keys etc) from Google. The spreadsheet needs to have one sheet called "Cohort". The script will take you through the authorisation flow the first time and generate a `token.json` (gitignored) from this that it will use on subsequent updating runs.
